# Code Tours

### A proposal to Learners Guild for a curricular enhancement

#### What?

“Code tour”: a time-limited demonstration of an application by its developer\(s\).

Components:

* Major specs: 2 minutes.
* Demo of app’s compliance with specs: 3 minutes.
* Code architecture, strategy, tactics: 10 minutes.
* Q&A and improvement recommendations: 5 minutes.

Implementations:

* Learners in P1, P2, and P3 give code tours officiated by 2 learners from 2 phases higher, organized as 3-tour, 1-hour sessions, open to other learners.
* Existing live code reviews conducted by SEPs convert to code-tour format.
* Each P1, P2, and P3 learner gives 1 code tour per week (except weeks of phase-boundary evaluations).
