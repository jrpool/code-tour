# Code Tours

### A curriculum-enhancement proposal to Learners Guild

#### What?

“Code tour”: a time-limited demonstration of an application by its developer\(s\).

Components:

* Major specs: 2 minutes.
* Demo of app’s compliance with specs: 3 minutes.
* Code architecture, strategy, tactics: 10 minutes.
* Q&A and improvement recommendations: 5 minutes.

Implementations:

* Learners in P1, P2, and P3 give code tours officiated by 2 learners from 2 phases higher, organized as 3-tour, 1-hour sessions, open to other learners.
* Existing live code reviews conducted by SEPs convert to code-tour format.
* Each P1, P2, and P3 learner gives 1 code tour per week (except weeks of phase-boundary evaluations).

#### Why?

* Improve presentations in phase-boundary interviews, helping SEPs accurately assess learner’s next-phase readiness.
* Skill applies to employment interviews, on-the-job all-hands presentations, training sessions, sales presentations, seminars, open-source project round-tables, funding pitches, etc.
