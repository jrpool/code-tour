# Code Tours

### A curriculum-enhancement proposal to Learners Guild

#### What?

“Code tour”: a time-limited demonstration of an application by one of its developers.

Components:

* Major specs: 2 minutes.
* Demo of app’s compliance with specs: 3 minutes.
* Code architecture, strategy, tactics: 10 minutes.
* Q&A and improvement recommendations: 5 minutes.

Implementations:

* Learners in P1, P2, and P3 give code tours officiated by 2 learners from 2 phases higher or 1 pro coach, organized as 3-tour, 1-hour sessions, open to other learners.
* Existing live code reviews conducted by SEPs convert to code-tour format.
* Each P1, P2, and P3 learner gives 1 code tour per week (except weeks of phase-boundary evaluations).

#### Why?

* Choosing, sequencing, and lucidly presenting topics within a time limit requires repeated practice.
* Presentations in phase-boundary interviews will improve, helping SEPs accurately assess next-phase readiness.
* Learner estimates of their own next-phase readiness will become more accurate, decreasing the time spent by SEPs and learners on repeated phase-boundary evaluations.
* Code-tour skills apply widely, including in:
 * Employment interviews
 * On-the-job all-hands presentations
 * Training sessions
 * Sales presentations
 * Seminars
 * Conferences
 * Open-source project progress reports
 * Funding pitches
* Officiating skills apply to service on interviewing panels in firms.
